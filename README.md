# Movie Correlation Analysis: Project Overview
• In this project I looked at what variables effect the gross revenue from movies.

## Programs Used
• Jupyter Notebook (Python)

## Results
• High correlation between a film's budget and its gross earnings and grew exponentially

• Created a correlation matrix to easily identifiy which variables (year, budget, gross earnings, votes) had the highest correlations
